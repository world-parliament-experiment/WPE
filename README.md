The World Parliament Experiment
==============================

This distribution is based on Symfony Version 5.4. It was developed to run under PHP 8.1

The BETA version is currently running [**here**][1].

If you want to collaborate please create a branch from the main branch "develop". 

Make use of the [**docker-symfony-wpe docker repository**][7] to create a local dev environment for the WPE.

For more information on desirability and potential of this project please see the Essay [**United Humans: Internet voting for a world parliament and a new world organization**][6].

Enjoy!
